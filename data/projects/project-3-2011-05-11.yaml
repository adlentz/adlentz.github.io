description: Carried out a research project that began with a human gene of unknown function and utilized a variety of bioinformatics tools to determine its functionality through gene conservation, gene expression, protein, and structural analyses. Utilized NCBI tools, SDSC Biology Workbench Multiple Sequence Alignment, Genomatix RNA sequencing, PSORT subcellular localization, STRING database for protein interactions, and PELE and PHYRE for protein structure to research gene functionality. <br><br> You can view the LRRN3 Wikipedia page that I created at the following [link](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRRN3). <br> **You can read my final report [here](//drive.google.com/file/d/0B1dNdWmUkBqqeTRLalpPWExMNW8/view?usp=sharing).**
